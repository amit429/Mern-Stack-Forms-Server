Here is the screenshots of the code and the database created in mongo db.
I have completed 2 out of 3 tasks given for the internship process. 

1) I have created a registration page that will register a user , store the details in the database and redirect to a welcome page with all the validations
2) I have created a contact us form as well which will help the user to post a query to the db and then display it on the queries page dynamically.
